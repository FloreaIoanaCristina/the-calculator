A calculator project written in C++. I used OOP concepts, as well as a personal rendition of queues and stacks.
This calculator has a menu in which you can select whether the ecuations are  to be taken from an external text file or written in console. 
It can calculate complex arithmetic ecuations with order of operations. 
It works for natural negative and real numbers.
The operations that can be performed are addition (+), multiplication(*), division(/),substraction(-), exponentiation(^) and roots(#).
